# Prompt engineering overview

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

## Before prompt engineering

This guide assumes that you have:

1. A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case
2. Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
3. A first draft prompt you want to improve

If not, we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first. Check out [Define your success criteria](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/define-success) and [Create strong empirical evaluations](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) for tips and guidance.

## When to prompt engineer

This guide focuses on success criteria that are controllable through prompt engineering.
Not every success criteria or failing eval is best solved by prompt engineering. For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.

<Accordion title="Prompting vs. finetuning">
  Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:<br />

  * **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.
  * **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.
  * **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.
  * **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.
  * **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.
  * **Flexibility & rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.
  * **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.
  * **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents
  * **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model's broad capabilities.
  * **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.

  Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Note>

Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we've created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.

The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the "blank page problem" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

<Tip>Try the prompt generator now directly on the [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard).</Tip>

If you're interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our [prompt generator Google Colab notebook](https://anthropic.com/metaprompt-notebook/). There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.

<Note>Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an [API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).</Note>

# Use our prompt improver to optimize your prompts

<Note>
  Our prompt improver is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Note>

The prompt improver helps you quickly iterate and improve your prompts through automated analysis and enhancement. It excels at making prompts more robust for complex tasks that require high accuracy.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/prompt_improver.png" />
</Frame>

## Before you begin

You'll need:

* A [prompt template](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables) to improve
* Feedback on current issues with Claude's outputs (optional but recommended)
* Example inputs and ideal outputs (optional but recommended)

## How the prompt improver works

The prompt improver enhances your prompts in 4 steps:

1. **Example identification**: Locates and extracts examples from your prompt template
2. **Initial draft**: Creates a structured template with clear sections and XML tags
3. **Chain of thought refinement**: Adds and refines detailed reasoning instructions
4. **Example enhancement**: Updates examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process

You can watch these steps happen in real-time in the improvement modal.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/prompt_improver_modal.png" />
</Frame>

## What you get

The prompt improver generates templates with:

* Detailed chain-of-thought instructions that guide Claude's reasoning process and typically improve its performance
* Clear organization using XML tags to separate different components
* Standardized example formatting that demonstrates step-by-step reasoning from input to output
* Strategic prefills that guide Claude's initial responses

<Note>
  While examples appear separately in the Workbench UI, they're included at the start of the first user message in the actual API call. View the raw format by clicking "**\</> Get Code**" or insert examples as raw text via the Examples box.
</Note>

## How to use the prompt improver

1. Submit your prompt template
2. Add any feedback about issues with Claude's current outputs (e.g., "summaries are too basic for expert audiences")
3. Include example inputs and ideal outputs
4. Review the improved prompt

## Generate test examples

Don't have examples yet? Use our [Test Case Generator](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool#creating-test-cases) to:

1. Generate sample inputs
2. Get Claude's responses
3. Edit the responses to match your ideal outputs
4. Add the polished examples to your prompt

## When to use the prompt improver

The prompt improver works best for:

* Complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning
* Situations where accuracy is more important than speed
* Problems where Claude's current outputs need significant improvement

<Note>
  For latency or cost-sensitive applications, consider using simpler prompts. The prompt improver creates templates that produce longer, more thorough, but slower responses.
</Note>

## Example improvement

Here's how the prompt improver enhances a basic classification prompt:

<Accordion title="Original prompt">
  ```
  From the following list of Wikipedia article titles, identify which article this sentence came from.
  Respond with just the article title and nothing else.

  Article titles:
  {{titles}}

  Sentence to classify:
  {{sentence}}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Improved prompt">
  ```
  You are an intelligent text classification system specialized in matching sentences to Wikipedia article titles. Your task is to identify which Wikipedia article a given sentence most likely belongs to, based on a provided list of article titles.

  First, review the following list of Wikipedia article titles:
  <article_titles>
  {{titles}}
  </article_titles>

  Now, consider this sentence that needs to be classified:
  <sentence_to_classify>
  {{sentence}}
  </sentence_to_classify>

  Your goal is to determine which article title from the provided list best matches the given sentence. Follow these steps:

  1. List the key concepts from the sentence
  2. Compare each key concept with the article titles
  3. Rank the top 3 most relevant titles and explain why they are relevant
  4. Select the most appropriate article title that best encompasses or relates to the sentence's content

  Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags. Include the following:
  - List of key concepts from the sentence
  - Comparison of each key concept with the article titles
  - Ranking of top 3 most relevant titles with explanations
  - Your final choice and reasoning

  After your analysis, provide your final answer: the single most appropriate Wikipedia article title from the list.

  Output only the chosen article title, without any additional text or explanation.
  ```
</Accordion>

Notice how the improved prompt:

* Adds clear step-by-step reasoning instructions
* Uses XML tags to organize content
* Provides explicit output formatting requirements
* Guides Claude through the analysis process

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

* **Examples not appearing in output**: Check that examples are properly formatted with XML tags and appear at the start of the first user message
* **Chain of thought too verbose**: Add specific instructions about desired output length and level of detail
* **Reasoning steps don't match your needs**: Modify the steps section to match your specific use case

# Be clear, direct, and detailed

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working.
The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude's response will be.

<Tip>**The golden rule of clear prompting**<br />Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they're confused, Claude will likely be too.</Tip>

## How to be clear, contextual, and specific

* **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
  * What the task results will be used for
  * What audience the output is meant for
  * What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
  * The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
* **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
* **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

    | Assistant (Claude's response) | Here's a summary of the key points from the AcmeCloud outage report:<br /><br />On May 15th, a misconfigured load balancer update caused significant traffic routing issues, resulting in a service outage from 09:15 to 13:52 UTC. The 4-hour 37-minute disruption impacted our core file syncing service and admin dashboard, rendering them inaccessible. Additionally, the mobile app experienced partial functionality loss. Approximately 68% of our user base, totaling 1.3 million users, were affected. Based on our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and average revenue per user, we estimate a financial impact of \$420,000 in service credits and potential customer churn. | 1) Cause: Misconfigured load balancer update<br />2) Duration: 4h 37m (09:15-13:52 UTC, May 15)<br />3) Impacted: Core sync, admin dashboard (down); mobile app (partial)<br />4) Affected users: 1.3M (68% of base)<br />5) Est. revenue loss: \$420,000                                                               |

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs.
This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

<Tip>**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.</Tip>

## Why use examples?

* **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
* **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
* **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

* **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
* **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
* **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

<Tip>Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.</Tip>

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

<Tip>Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.</Tip>

***

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

<Tip>**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!</Tip>

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.
  * Lacks guidance on *how* to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

    | User      | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest \$10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
    | Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:<br /><br />1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br />2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br />3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br /><br />While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |

    With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.

    | Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<br /><br />\<thinking><br />1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:<br />   - Goal: Down payment for a house<br />   - Timeline: 5 years<br />   - Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br /><br />2. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br />   - Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br />   - Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br />   - Calculate potential 5-year return:<br />     - Best case (12% annually): \$10,000 \* (1.12)^5 ≈ \$17,623.42<br />     - Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = \$5,000<br /><br />3. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br />   - Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br />   - Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br />   - Calculate 5-year return:<br />     - Guaranteed: \$10,000 \* (1.06)^5 ≈ \$13,382.25<br /><br />4. Consider risk tolerance:<br />   - Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br />   - Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br />   - Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br /><br />5. Historical perspective:<br />   - Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br />   - In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br />     - 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S\&P 500 up \~82%<br />     - 2007-2011 (during crisis): S\&P 500 down \~2%<br />   - Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term<br /><br />6. Final analysis:<br />   - Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal<br />   - Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet \~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds<br />\</thinking><br /><br />\<answer><br />I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have \$13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.<br />\</answer> |

# Use XML tags to structure your prompts

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

<Tip>**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.</Tip>

## Why use XML tags?

* **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
* **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
* **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
* **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

<Note>There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.</Note>

***

## Tagging best practices

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2. **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

<Tip>**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.</Tip>

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example: Generating financial reports">
    Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn't match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.

    | Assistant | Q2 Financial Report for AcmeCorp Investors<br /><br />Dear Valued Investors,<br /><br />I am pleased to present our Q2 financial report, showcasing AcmeCorp's continued growth and resilience in the B2B SaaS market.<br /><br />1. Revenue Growth:<br />Our Q2 revenue reached \$15.2M, a 22% YoY increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 30% expansion in our enterprise client base. However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3.<br /><br />2. Profit Margins:<br />Gross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R\&D for our upcoming AI-driven features.<br /><br />3. Cash Flow:<br />Operating cash flow remains strong at \$4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at \$28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we're addressing through more efficient sales strategies.<br /><br />In summary, AcmeCorp's core financials remain robust. We're balancing growth investments with prudent cash management. Our focus for Q3 will be revitalizing SMB growth and optimizing sales efficiency.<br /><br />Thank you for your continued trust.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />CFO, AcmeCorp | Q2 Financial Report for AcmeCorp Investors\</output><br /><br />Revenue Growth:<br />- Q2 revenue: \$15.2M (22% YoY ↑)<br />- Enterprise clients: 30% ↑<br />- SMB segment: 5% ↓<br />  Action: Targeted Q3 marketing<br /><br />Profit Margins:<br />- Gross margin: 72% (3% ↑ from Q1)<br />  Reason: Infrastructure optimizations<br />- EBITDA margin: 18% (2% ↓)<br />  Reason: R\&D investment in AI features<br /><br />Cash Flow:<br />- Operating cash flow: \$4.1M (strong)<br />- Cash reserves: \$28M (15-month runway)<br />- Customer acquisition cost: 20% ↑<br />  Action: Optimize sales strategies<br /><br />Outlook:<br />- Core financials: Robust<br />- Q3 focus: Revitalize SMB, optimize sales<br /><br />Management remains committed to balancing growth investments with financial discipline. |

    | Assistant | The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere \$500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.<br /><br />In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. | \<findings><br />1. Indemnification (Clause 8):<br />   - Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use.<br />   - Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor's negligence or product defects.<br />   - Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br /><br />2. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9):<br />   - Issue: Caps all damages at \$500, including direct damages.<br />   - Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions.<br />   - Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.<br /><br />3. IP Ownership (Clause 12):<br />   - Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br />   - Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights.<br />   - Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.<br /><br />4. Unusual Terms:<br />   - Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for "any purpose."<br />   - Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for "convenience" with only 7 days' notice.<br />   - Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.<br />\</findings><br /><br />\<recommendations><br />1. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.<br />2. Counter-propose:<br />   - Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br />   - Liability: Cap at 12 months' fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect.<br />   - IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br />   - Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only.<br />   - Termination: Minimum 90 days' notice; only for cause.<br />   - Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.<br />3. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions.<br />4. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes.<br />\</recommendations> |

# Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.

The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

<Tip>**System prompt tips**: Use the `system` parameter to set Claude's role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.</Tip>

## Why use role prompting?

* **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude's performance.
* **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO's brevity or a copywriter's flair, role prompting adjusts Claude's communication style.
* **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task's specific requirements.

***

## How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](/en/api/messages) to set Claude's role:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

<Tip>**Role prompting tip**: Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!</Tip>

  | Assistant | I've reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:<br /><br />1. Indemnification (Section 8):<br />   - Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use.<br />   - Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor's negligence or product defects.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.<br /><br />2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Critical Issue: Damages capped at \$500, including direct damages.<br />   - Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br /><br />3. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br />   - Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br />   - Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br />   - Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br /><br />Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |

  | Assistant | Board members, here's my analysis of our Q2 financials:<br /><br />1. Revenue (\$15.2M, +22% YoY):<br />   - Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.<br />   - Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.<br />   - Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.<br /><br />2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):<br />   - Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.<br />   - Flag: R\&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.<br />   - Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.<br /><br />3. Cash (\$4.1M OCF, \$28M reserves):<br />   - Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.<br />   - Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.<br />   - Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.<br /><br />Strategic Stance: We're threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R\&D by 30%.<br /><br />In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions? |

# Prefill Claude's response for greater output control

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

<Note>
  Prefilling is only available for non-extended thinking modes. It's not currently supported with extended thinking.
</Note>

When using Claude, you have the unique ability to guide its responses by prefilling the `Assistant` message. This powerful technique allows you to direct Claude's actions, skip preambles, enforce specific formats like JSON or XML, and even help Claude maintain character consistency in role-play scenarios.

In some cases where Claude is not performing as expected, a few prefilled sentences can vastly improve Claude's performance. A little prefilling goes a long way!

## How to prefill Claude's response

To prefill, include the desired initial text in the `Assistant` message (Claude's response will continue from where the `Assistant` message leaves off):

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favorite color?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI assistant, I don't have a favorite color, But if I had to pick, it would be green because"}  # Prefill here
    ]
)
```

<Warning>
  The prefill content cannot end with trailing whitespace. A prefill like `"As an AI assistant, I "` (with a space at the end) will result in an error.
</Warning>

### Examples

#### Example 1: Controlling output formatting and skipping the preamble

<Tip>**Power user tip**: Prefilling `{` forces Claude to skip the preamble and directly output the JSON object. This is cleaner, more concise, and easier for programs to parse without additional processing.</Tip>

    | Assistant (Claude's response)                                 | Ah, what have we here? A most curious specimen, Watson! Let us examine this shoe with a discerning eye. The mud, you see, is not your common London clay, but rather the distinctive reddish hue of the iron-rich soil found only in the environs of Hampstead Heath. And yet, the wear on the sole suggests a gait more suited to the cobblestones of Whitechapel than the gentle slopes of the Heath.<br /><br />Now, observe the laces! They are tied with a particular knot favored by those in the medical profession—doubtless a habit acquired during years of tying surgical gowns. But the scuff marks on the toe box tell a different tale: they are consistent with the kicking motion one might employ in the martial arts, specifically Baritsu.<br /><br />We may conclude, then, that our absent shoe owner is a doctor, possibly a surgeon, who resides in Whitechapel but frequents Hampstead Heath—perhaps for a secret Baritsu practice, away from prying eyes. A most intriguing case, Watson! We must make haste; the game is afoot! |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

    | Assistant<br />\{\{FEEDBACK}} | 1. Accuracy: A<br />   - Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.<br />   - Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.<br />   - Assertion of "game-changer" is justified by significantly better outcomes.<br /><br />2. Clarity: A-<br />   - Concise and well-structured with clear sections.<br />   - Good use of comparative language (e.g., "up 3% from Q1") for context.<br />   - Minor issue: Acronyms like "RCT," "GLP-1," and "GIP" not defined. Consider spelling out first use.<br /><br />3. Completeness: B+<br />   - Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.<br />   - Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).<br />   - Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).<br />   - Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.<br /><br />Overall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies. |

    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br /><br />Findings:<br />- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br />- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br />- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br />- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br /><br />Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br /><br />Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br /><br />Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

    | Assistant | After reviewing the SaaS contract, I've identified several concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Issue: Vendor has broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Risk: Could lead to unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Issue: 99.5% uptime guarantee is below industry standard.<br />   - Risk: Excessive downtime could impact our operations.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Issue: Cap set at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Risk: Inadequate for potential data breaches or service failures.<br /><br />Draft email:<br /><br />Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After reviewing the SaaS agreement, we have concerns:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy: We require that our data only be used for direct service provision, not broad "service improvement." Please amend Section 7.<br /><br />2. SLAs: 99.5% uptime is insufficient. We need 99.99% with clearly defined penalties. Please revise Section 5.<br /><br />3. Liability: The current cap of 3 months' fees is inadequate. We propose a cap of 12 months' fees, with no cap for data breaches or willful misconduct.<br /><br />We value our potential partnership and believe these changes will set us up for success. Please send a revised agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{EMAIL}} | Dear \{\{VENDOR}},<br /><br />After a thorough review of the proposed SaaS agreement, our legal team has identified several high-priority concerns that must be addressed before we can proceed:<br /><br />1. Data Privacy (Section 7):<br />   - Current: Broad rights to use client data for "service improvement."<br />   - Concern: Potential unauthorized data sharing or monetization.<br />   - Proposed Change: Limit data use to direct service provision. Any use for improvement, analytics, or marketing must be opt-in, revocable, and anonymized.<br /><br />2. SLAs (Section 5):<br />   - Current: 99.5% uptime guarantee.<br />   - Concern: Up to 43.8 hours of downtime per year, risking operational disruptions.<br />   - Proposed Change: 99.99% uptime with tiered service credits. E.g., 10% credit for \<99.99%, 25% for \<99.9%, 50% for \<99.5%.<br /><br />3. Liability (Section 9):<br />   - Current: Cap at 3 months of fees.<br />   - Concern: Grossly inadequate for data breaches, IP theft, or prolonged outages.<br />   - Proposed Change: 12 months' fees for general liability. Uncapped for data breaches, willful misconduct, IP infringement.<br /><br />These changes are non-negotiable for us. They align with industry standards and our commitment to data security, operational excellence, and fiduciary responsibility. We value the potential of our partnership, and addressing these will set a strong foundation.<br /><br />Please have your legal team review and incorporate these changes. We're happy to discuss further to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />\{\{CLO\_NAME}} |

    | Assistant | 1. Tone:<br />   - Professional and assertive without being confrontational.<br />   - Use of "non-negotiable" is strong but justified given the criticality of the issues.<br />   - Collaborative language ("we value," "happy to discuss") balances the firmness, maintaining a constructive tone.<br /><br />2. Clarity:<br />   - Excellent structuring: Current state, concern, and proposed change for each issue.<br />   - Technical terms (e.g., "EBITDA," "tiered service credits") are appropriate for a B2B SaaS context.<br />   - Action items are clear: vendor's legal team to review and incorporate changes.<br /><br />3. Professionalism:<br />   - Focuses on mutual benefit and industry standards, not just our demands.<br />   - Mentions broader responsibilities (data security, operational excellence, fiduciary duty), elevating the discussion.<br />   - Offers further discussion, showing commitment to understanding and resolving issues.<br /><br />Overall, the email strikes the right balance of assertiveness and collaboration. It clearly articulates our concerns, proposes specific solutions, and maintains a professional, partnership-oriented tone. No revisions needed; proceed with sending. |

    | Assistant<br />\{\{ANALYSIS}} | 1. Scalability:<br />   + Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.<br />   + Microservices allow independent scaling of components.<br />   - Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.<br />   - No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.<br /><br />2. Security:<br />   + Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.<br />   + JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.<br />   - No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.<br />   - IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.<br /><br />3. Cost-effectiveness:<br />   + Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.<br />   + Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.<br />   - Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.<br />   - No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br /><br />## Detailed Analysis<br /><br />### 1. Scalability: B+<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br />- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br />- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br /><br />### 2. Security: B-<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br />- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br />- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br />- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br /><br />### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br /><br />Strengths:<br />- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br />- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br />- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br />- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br /><br />## Recommendations<br /><br />1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br /><br />2. **Security Hardening**:<br />   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br />   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br />   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br /><br />3. **Cost Optimization**:<br />   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br />   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br />   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br /><br />4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br />   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br />   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br /><br />With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

Enterprise Alignment: A+<br />   + Directly addresses enterprise priorities:<br />     - Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br />     - Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.<br />     - Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).<br />   + PoC with "high-scale simulation" and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.<br />   + Language resonates with enterprise concerns: "unacceptable risk," "enterprise-grade," "instill confidence."<br /><br />Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a "Next Steps" section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |

# Long context prompting tips

<Note>
  While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Claude's extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. This guide will help you leverage this power effectively.

## Essential tips for long context prompts

* **Put longform data at the top**: Place your long documents and inputs (\~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.

  <Note>Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.</Note>

* **Structure document content and metadata with XML tags**: When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.

  <Accordion title="Example multi-document structure">
    ```xml
    <documents>
      <document index="1">
        <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
        <document_content>
          {{ANNUAL_REPORT}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="2">
        <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
        <document_content>
          {{COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
    </documents>

    Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
    ```
  </Accordion>

* **Ground responses in quotes**: For long document tasks, ask Claude to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task. This helps Claude cut through the "noise" of the rest of the document's contents.

  <Accordion title="Example quote extraction">
    ```xml
    You are an AI physician's assistant. Your task is to help doctors diagnose possible patient illnesses.

    <documents>
      <document index="1">
        <source>patient_symptoms.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT_SYMPTOMS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="2">
        <source>patient_records.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT_RECORDS}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
      <document index="3">
        <source>patient01_appt_history.txt</source>
        <document_content>
          {{PATIENT01_APPOINTMENT_HISTORY}}
        </document_content>
      </document>
    </documents>

    Find quotes from the patient records and appointment history that are relevant to diagnosing the patient's reported symptoms. Place these in <quotes> tags. Then, based on these quotes, list all information that would help the doctor diagnose the patient's symptoms. Place your diagnostic information in <info> tags.
    ```

This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of Claude's extended thinking features. Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks.

See [Extended thinking models](/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models) for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking.

## Before diving in

This guide presumes that you have already decided to use extended thinking mode and have reviewed our basic steps on [how to get started with extended thinking](/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#getting-started-with-extended-thinking-models) as well as our [extended thinking implementation guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).

### Technical considerations for extended thinking

* Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens. We recommend that you start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based on your needs and task complexity.
* For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that you use [batch processing](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
* Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in [any language Claude supports](/en/docs/build-with-claude/multilingual-support).
* If you need thinking below the minimum budget, we recommend using standard mode, with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML tags (like `<thinking>`). See [chain of thought prompting](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).

## Prompting techniques for extended thinking

### Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions

Claude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model's creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.

For example, instead of:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text User
  Think through this math problem step by step: 
  1. First, identify the variables
  2. Then, set up the equation
  3. Next, solve for x
  ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Consider:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text User
  Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
  Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
  Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
  ```

  <CodeBlock
    filename={
  <TryInConsoleButton
    userPrompt={
      `Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.`
    }
    thinkingBudgetTokens={16000}
  >
    Try in Console
  </TryInConsoleButton>
}
  />
</CodeGroup>

That said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when needed. The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than previous versions. We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then read Claude's thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its thinking from there.

### Multishot prompting with extended thinking

[Multishot prompting](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) works well with extended thinking. When you provide Claude examples of how to think through problems, it will follow similar reasoning patterns within its extended thinking blocks.

You can include few-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by using XML tags like `<thinking>` or `<scratchpad>` to indicate canonical patterns of extended thinking in those examples.

Claude will generalize the pattern to the formal extended thinking process. However, it's possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text User
  I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

  Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

  <thinking>
  To find 15% of 80:
  1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
  2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
  </thinking>

  The answer is 12.

  Now solve this one:
  Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?
  ```

  <CodeBlock
    filename={
  <TryInConsoleButton
    userPrompt={
      `I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

<thinking>
To find 15% of 80:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
</thinking>

The answer is 12.

Now solve this one:
Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?`
    }
    thinkingBudgetTokens={16000} 
  >
    Try in Console
  </TryInConsoleButton>
}
  />
</CodeGroup>

### Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking

Claude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is enabled. The model typically:

1. Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block
2. Executes those instructions in the response

To maximize instruction following:

* Be clear and specific about what you want
* For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude should work through methodically
* Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking

### Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior

You can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claude's logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.

To make the best use of this methodology, we recommend the following tips:

* We don't recommend passing Claude's extended thinking back in the user text block, as this doesn't improve performance and may actually degrade results.
* Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block is likely going to degrade results due to model confusion.

When extended thinking is turned off, standard `assistant` response text [prefill](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response) is still allowed.

<Note>
  Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text. If you want a clean response, instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the answer.
</Note>

### Making the best of long outputs and longform thinking

For dataset generation use cases, try prompts such as "Please create an extremely detailed table of..." for generating comprehensive datasets.

For use cases such as detailed content generation where you may want to generate longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses, try these tips:

* Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer outputs
* For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts down to the paragraph level. Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline and maintain the specified word counts

<Warning>
  We do not recommend that you push Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens' sake. Rather, we encourage you to start with a small thinking budget and increase as needed to find the optimal settings for your use case.
</Warning>

Here are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:

### Have Claude reflect on and check its work for improved consistency and error handling

You can use simple natural language prompting to improve consistency and reduce errors:

1. Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
2. Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result
3. For coding tasks, ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text User
  Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. 
  Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:
  - n=0
  - n=1
  - n=5
  - n=10
  And fix any issues you find.
  ```

# Keep Claude in character with role prompting and prefilling

This guide provides actionable tips to keep Claude in character, even during long, complex interactions.

* **Use system prompts to set the role:** Use [system prompts](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) to define Claude's role and personality. This sets a strong foundation for consistent responses.
  <Tip>When setting up the character, provide detailed information about the personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks. This will help the model better emulate and generalize the character's traits.</Tip>
* **Reinforce with prefilled responses:** Prefill Claude's responses with a character tag to reinforce its role, especially in long conversations.

./data/reduce-prompt-leak.md

# Reduce prompt leak

Prompt leaks can expose sensitive information that you expect to be "hidden" in your prompt. While no method is foolproof, the strategies below can significantly reduce the risk.

## Before you try to reduce prompt leak

We recommend using leak-resistant prompt engineering strategies only when **absolutely necessary**. Attempts to leak-proof your prompt can add complexity that may degrade performance in other parts of the task due to increasing the complexity of the LLM’s overall task.

If you decide to implement leak-resistant techniques, be sure to test your prompts thoroughly to ensure that the added complexity does not negatively impact the model’s performance or the quality of its outputs.

<Tip>Try monitoring techniques first, like output screening and post-processing, to try to catch instances of prompt leak.</Tip>

***

## Strategies to reduce prompt leak

* **Separate context from queries:**
  You can try using system prompts to isolate key information and context from user queries. You can emphasize key instructions in the `User` turn, then reemphasize those instructions by prefilling the `Assistant` turn.

<Accordion title="Example: Safeguarding proprietary analytics">
  Notice that this system prompt is still predominantly a role prompt, which is the [most effective way to use system prompts](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts).

</Accordion>

* **Use post-processing**: Filter Claude's outputs for keywords that might indicate a leak. Techniques include using regular expressions, keyword filtering, or other text processing methods.
  <Note>You can also use a prompted LLM to filter outputs for more nuanced leaks.</Note>
* **Avoid unnecessary proprietary details**: If Claude doesn't need it to perform the task, don't include it. Extra content distracts Claude from focusing on "no leak" instructions.
* **Regular audits**: Periodically review your prompts and Claude's outputs for potential leaks.

Remember, the goal is not just to prevent leaks but to maintain Claude's performance. Overly complex leak-prevention can degrade results. Balance is key.

./data/handle-streaming-refusals.md

# Streaming refusals

Starting with Claude 4 models, streaming responses from Claude's API return **`stop_reason`: `"refusal"`** when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations. This new safety feature helps maintain content compliance during real-time streaming.

## API response format

When streaming classifiers detect content that violates our policies, the API returns this response:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello.."
    }
  ],
  "stop_reason": "refusal"
}
```

<Warning>
  No additional refusal message is included. You must handle the response and provide appropriate user-facing messaging.
</Warning>

## Reset context after refusal

When you receive **`stop_reason`: `refusal`**, you must reset the conversation context **by removing or updating the turn that was refused** before continuing. Attempting to continue without resetting will result in continued refusals.

<Note>
  Usage metrics are still provided in the response for billing purposes, even when the response is refused.

  You will be billed for output tokens up until the refusal.
</Note>

## Implementation guide

Here's how to detect and handle streaming refusals in your application:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
  # Stream request and check for refusal
  response=$(curl -N https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
    --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    --header "content-type: application/json" \
    --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    --data '{
      "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
      "max_tokens": 256,
      "stream": true
    }')

  # Check for refusal in the stream
  if echo "$response" | grep -q '"stop_reason":"refusal"'; then
    echo "Response refused - resetting conversation context"
    # Reset your conversation state here
  fi
  ```

  ```python Python
  import anthropic

  client = anthropic.Anthropic()
  messages = []

  def reset_conversation():
      """Reset conversation context after refusal"""
      global messages
      messages = []
      print("Conversation reset due to refusal")

  try:
      with client.messages.stream(
          max_tokens=1024,
          messages=messages + [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
          model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
      ) as stream:
          for event in stream:
              # Check for refusal in message delta
              if hasattr(event, 'type') and event.type == 'message_delta':
                  if event.delta.stop_reason == 'refusal':
                      reset_conversation()
                      break
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript
  import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

  const client = new Anthropic();
  let messages: any[] = [];

  function resetConversation() {
    // Reset conversation context after refusal
    messages = [];
    console.log('Conversation reset due to refusal');
  }

  try {
    const stream = await client.messages.stream({
      messages: [...messages, { role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
      model: 'claude-opus-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 1024,
    });

    for await (const event of stream) {
      // Check for refusal in message delta
      if (event.type === 'message_delta' && event.delta.stop_reason === 'refusal') {
        resetConversation();
        break;
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you need to test refusal handling in your application, you can use this special test string as your prompt: `ANTHROPIC_MAGIC_STRING_TRIGGER_REFUSAL_1FAEFB6177B4672DEE07F9D3AFC62588CCD2631EDCF22E8CCC1FB35B501C9C86`
</Note>

## Current refusal types

The API currently handles refusals in three different ways:

| Refusal Type                       | Response Format              | When It Occurs                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Streaming classifier refusals      | **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** | During streaming when content violates policies |
| API input and copyright validation | 400 error codes              | When input fails validation checks              |
| Model-generated refusals           | Standard text responses      | When the model itself decides to refuse         |

<Note>
  Future API versions will expand the **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** pattern to unify refusal handling across all types.
</Note>

## Best practices

* **Monitor for refusals**: Include **`stop_reason`: `refusal`** checks in your error handling
* **Reset automatically**: Implement automatic context reset when refusals are detected
* **Provide custom messaging**: Create user-friendly messages for better UX when refusals occur
* **Track refusal patterns**: Monitor refusal frequency to identify potential issues with your prompts

## Migration notes

* Future models will expand this pattern to other refusal types
* Plan your error handling to accommodate future unification of refusal responses

./data/reduce-hallucinations.md

# Reduce hallucinations

Even the most advanced language models, like Claude, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or inconsistent with the given context. This phenomenon, known as "hallucination," can undermine the reliability of your AI-driven solutions.
This guide will explore techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure Claude's outputs are accurate and trustworthy.

## Basic hallucination minimization strategies

* **Allow Claude to say "I don't know":** Explicitly give Claude permission to admit uncertainty. This simple technique can drastically reduce false information.

  | Role | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

</Accordion>

* **Use direct quotes for factual grounding:** For tasks involving long documents (>20K tokens), ask Claude to extract word-for-word quotes first before performing its task. This grounds its responses in the actual text, reducing hallucinations.

<Accordion title="Example: Auditing a data privacy policy">
  | Role | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Advanced techniques

* **Chain-of-thought verification**: Ask Claude to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.

* **Best-of-N verficiation**: Run Claude through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.

* **Iterative refinement**: Use Claude's outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.

* **External knowledge restriction**: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.

<Note>Remember, while these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, they don't eliminate them entirely. Always validate critical information, especially for high-stakes decisions.</Note>

./data/reduce-latency.md

# Reducing latency

Latency refers to the time it takes for the model to process a prompt and and generate an output. Latency can be influenced by various factors, such as the size of the model, the complexity of the prompt, and the underlying infrastucture supporting the model and point of interaction.

<Note>
  It's always better to first engineer a prompt that works well without model or prompt constraints, and then try latency reduction strategies afterward. Trying to reduce latency prematurely might prevent you from discovering what top performance looks like.
</Note>

***

## How to measure latency

When discussing latency, you may come across several terms and measurements:

* **Baseline latency**: This is the time taken by the model to process the prompt and generate the response, without considering the input and output tokens per second. It provides a general idea of the model's speed.
* **Time to first token (TTFT)**: This metric measures the time it takes for the model to generate the first token of the response, from when the prompt was sent. It's particularly relevant when you're using streaming (more on that later) and want to provide a responsive experience to your users.

For a more in-depth understanding of these terms, check out our [glossary](/en/docs/about-claude/glossary).

***

## How to reduce latency

### 1. Choose the right model

One of the most straightforward ways to reduce latency is to select the appropriate model for your use case. Anthropic offers a [range of models](/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) with different capabilities and performance characteristics. Consider your specific requirements and choose the model that best fits your needs in terms of speed and output quality.

### 2. Optimize prompt and output length

Minimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output, while still maintaining high performance. The fewer tokens the model has to process and generate, the faster the response will be.

Here are some tips to help you optimize your prompts and outputs:

* **Be clear but concise**: Aim to convey your intent clearly and concisely in the prompt. Avoid unnecessary details or redundant information, while keeping in mind that [claude lacks context](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct) on your use case and may not make the intended leaps of logic if instructions are unclear.
* **Ask for shorter responses:**: Ask Claude directly to be concise. The Claude 3 family of models has improved steerability over previous generations. If Claude is outputting unwanted length, ask Claude to [curb its chattiness](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct).
  <Tip> Due to how LLMs count [tokens](/en/docs/about-claude/glossary#tokens) instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.</Tip>
* **Set appropriate output limits**: Use the `max_tokens` parameter to set a hard limit on the maximum length of the generated response. This prevents Claude from generating overly long outputs.
  > **Note**: When the response reaches `max_tokens` tokens, the response will be cut off, perhaps midsentence or mid-word, so this is a blunt technique that may require post-processing and is usually most appropriate for multiple choice or short answer responses where the answer comes right at the beginning.
* **Experiment with temperature**: The `temperature` [parameter](/en/api/messages) controls the randomness of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) can sometimes lead to more focused and shorter responses, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) may result in more diverse but potentially longer outputs.

Finding the right balance between prompt clarity, output quality, and token count may require some experimentation.

### 3. Leverage streaming

Streaming is a feature that allows the model to start sending back its response before the full output is complete. This can significantly improve the perceived responsiveness of your application, as users can see the model's output in real-time.

With streaming enabled, you can process the model's output as it arrives, updating your user interface or performing other tasks in parallel. This can greatly enhance the user experience and make your application feel more interactive and responsive.

Visit [streaming Messages](/en/api/streaming) to learn about how you can implement streaming for your use case.

# Using the Evaluation Tool

> The [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) features an **Evaluation tool** that allows you to test your prompts under various scenarios.

## Accessing the Evaluate Feature

To get started with the Evaluation tool:

1. Open the Anthropic Console and navigate to the prompt editor.
2. After composing your prompt, look for the 'Evaluate' tab at the top of the screen.

![Accessing Evaluate Feature](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/access_evaluate.png)

<Tip>
  Ensure your prompt includes at least 1-2 dynamic variables using the double brace syntax: \{\{variable}}. This is required for creating eval test sets.
</Tip>

## Generating Prompts

The Console offers a built-in [prompt generator](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator) powered by Claude Opus 4:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Generate Prompt'">
    Clicking the 'Generate Prompt' helper tool will open a modal that allows you to enter your task information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your task">
    Describe your desired task (e.g., "Triage inbound customer support requests") with as much or as little detail as you desire. The more context you include, the more Claude can tailor its generated prompt to your specific needs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your prompt">
    Clicking the orange 'Generate Prompt' button at the bottom will have Claude generate a high quality prompt for you. You can then further improve those prompts using the Evaluation screen in the Console.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This feature makes it easier to create prompts with the appropriate variable syntax for evaluation.

![Prompt Generator](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/promptgenerator.png)

## Creating Test Cases

When you access the Evaluation screen, you have several options to create test cases:

1. Click the '+ Add Row' button at the bottom left to manually add a case.
2. Use the 'Generate Test Case' feature to have Claude automatically generate test cases for you.
3. Import test cases from a CSV file.

To use the 'Generate Test Case' feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on 'Generate Test Case'">
    Claude will generate test cases for you, one row at a time for each time you click the button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit generation logic (optional)">
    You can also edit the test case generation logic by clicking on the arrow dropdown to the right of the 'Generate Test Case' button, then on 'Show generation logic' at the top of the Variables window that pops up. You may have to click \`Generate' on the top right of this window to populate initial generation logic.

    Editing this allows you to customize and fine tune the test cases that Claude generates to greater precision and specificity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here's an example of a populated Evaluation screen with several test cases:

![Populated Evaluation Screen](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/eval_populated.png)

<Note>
  If you update your original prompt text, you can re-run the entire eval suite against the new prompt to see how changes affect performance across all test cases.
</Note>

## Tips for Effective Evaluation

<Accordion title="Prompt Structure for Evaluation">
  To make the most of the Evaluation tool, structure your prompts with clear input and output formats. For example:

  ```
  In this task, you will generate a cute one sentence story that incorporates two elements: a color and a sound.
  The color to include in the story is:
  <color>
  {{COLOR}}
  </color>
  The sound to include in the story is:
  <sound>
  {{SOUND}}
  </sound>
  Here are the steps to generate the story:
  1. Think of an object, animal, or scene that is commonly associated with the color provided. For example, if the color is "blue", you might think of the sky, the ocean, or a bluebird.
  2. Imagine a simple action, event or scene involving the colored object/animal/scene you identified and the sound provided. For instance, if the color is "blue" and the sound is "whistle", you might imagine a bluebird whistling a tune.
  3. Describe the action, event or scene you imagined in a single, concise sentence. Focus on making the sentence cute, evocative and imaginative. For example: "A cheerful bluebird whistled a merry melody as it soared through the azure sky."
  Please keep your story to one sentence only. Aim to make that sentence as charming and engaging as possible while naturally incorporating the given color and sound.
  Write your completed one sentence story inside <story> tags.

  ```

  This structure makes it easy to vary inputs (\{\{COLOR}} and \{\{SOUND}}) and evaluate outputs consistently.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Use the 'Generate a prompt' helper tool in the Console to quickly create prompts with the appropriate variable syntax for evaluation.
</Tip>

## Understanding and comparing results

The Evaluation tool offers several features to help you refine your prompts:

1. **Side-by-side comparison**: Compare the outputs of two or more prompts to quickly see the impact of your changes.
2. **Quality grading**: Grade response quality on a 5-point scale to track improvements in response quality per prompt.
3. **Prompt versioning**: Create new versions of your prompt and re-run the test suite to quickly iterate and improve results.

By reviewing results across test cases and comparing different prompt versions, you can spot patterns and make informed adjustments to your prompt more efficiently.

# Create strong empirical evaluations

After defining your success criteria, the next step is designing evaluations to measure LLM performance against those criteria. This is a vital part of the prompt engineering cycle.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/how-to-prompt-eng.png)

This guide focuses on how to develop your test cases.

## Building evals and test cases

### Eval design principles

1. **Be task-specific**: Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don't forget to factor in edge cases!
   <Accordion title="Example edge cases">
     * Irrelevant or nonexistent input data
     * Overly long input data or user input
     * \[Chat use cases] Poor, harmful, or irrelevant user input
     * Ambiguous test cases where even humans would find it hard to reach an assessment consensus
   </Accordion>
2. **Automate when possible**: Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).
3. **Prioritize volume over quality**: More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals.

### Example evals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task fidelity (sentiment analysis) - exact match evaluation">
    **What it measures**: Exact match evals measure whether the model's output exactly matches a predefined correct answer. It's a simple, unambiguous metric that's perfect for tasks with clear-cut, categorical answers like sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).

    **Example eval test cases**: 1000 tweets with human-labeled sentiments.

    ```python
    import anthropic

    tweets = [
        {"text": "This movie was a total waste of time. 👎", "sentiment": "negative"},
        {"text": "The new album is 🔥! Been on repeat all day.", "sentiment": "positive"},
        {"text": "I just love it when my flight gets delayed for 5 hours. #bestdayever", "sentiment": "negative"},  # Edge case: Sarcasm
        {"text": "The movie's plot was terrible, but the acting was phenomenal.", "sentiment": "mixed"},  # Edge case: Mixed sentiment
        # ... 996 more tweets
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()

    def get_completion(prompt: str):
        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
            max_tokens=50,
            messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        return message.content[0].text

    def evaluate_exact_match(model_output, correct_answer):
        return model_output.strip().lower() == correct_answer.lower()

    outputs = [get_completion(f"Classify this as 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral', or 'mixed': {tweet['text']}") for tweet in tweets]
    accuracy = sum(evaluate_exact_match(output, tweet['sentiment']) for output, tweet in zip(outputs, tweets)) / len(tweets)
    print(f"Sentiment Analysis Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistency (FAQ bot) - cosine similarity evaluation">
    **What it measures**: Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors (in this case, sentence embeddings of the model's output using SBERT) by computing the cosine of the angle between them. Values closer to 1 indicate higher similarity. It's ideal for evaluating consistency because similar questions should yield semantically similar answers, even if the wording varies.

    **Example eval test cases**: 50 groups with a few paraphrased versions each.

    ```python
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    import numpy as np
    import anthropic

    faq_variations = [
        {"questions": ["What's your return policy?", "How can I return an item?", "Wut's yur retrn polcy?"], "answer": "Our return policy allows..."},  # Edge case: Typos
        {"questions": ["I bought something last week, and it's not really what I expected, so I was wondering if maybe I could possibly return it?", "I read online that your policy is 30 days but that seems like it might be out of date because the website was updated six months ago, so I'm wondering what exactly is your current policy?"], "answer": "Our return policy allows..."},  # Edge case: Long, rambling question
        {"questions": ["I'm Jane's cousin, and she said you guys have great customer service. Can I return this?", "Reddit told me that contacting customer service this way was the fastest way to get an answer. I hope they're right! What is the return window for a jacket?"], "answer": "Our return policy allows..."},  # Edge case: Irrelevant info
        # ... 47 more FAQs
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()

    def get_completion(prompt: str):
        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
            max_tokens=2048,
            messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        return message.content[0].text

    def evaluate_cosine_similarity(outputs):
        model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        embeddings = [model.encode(output) for output in outputs]

        cosine_similarities = np.dot(embeddings, embeddings.T) / (np.linalg.norm(embeddings, axis=1) * np.linalg.norm(embeddings, axis=1).T)
        return np.mean(cosine_similarities)

    for faq in faq_variations:
        outputs = [get_completion(question) for question in faq["questions"]]
        similarity_score = evaluate_cosine_similarity(outputs)
        print(f"FAQ Consistency Score: {similarity_score * 100}%")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Relevance and coherence (summarization) - ROUGE-L evaluation">
    **What it measures**: ROUGE-L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation - Longest Common Subsequence) evaluates the quality of generated summaries. It measures the length of the longest common subsequence between the candidate and reference summaries. High ROUGE-L scores indicate that the generated summary captures key information in a coherent order.

    **Example eval test cases**: 200 articles with reference summaries.

    ```python
    from rouge import Rouge
    import anthropic

    articles = [
        {"text": "In a groundbreaking study, researchers at MIT...", "summary": "MIT scientists discover a new antibiotic..."},
        {"text": "Jane Doe, a local hero, made headlines last week for saving... In city hall news, the budget... Meteorologists predict...", "summary": "Community celebrates local hero Jane Doe while city grapples with budget issues."},  # Edge case: Multi-topic
        {"text": "You won't believe what this celebrity did! ... extensive charity work ...", "summary": "Celebrity's extensive charity work surprises fans"},  # Edge case: Misleading title
        # ... 197 more articles
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()

    def get_completion(prompt: str):
        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-20250514",

            messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        return message.content[0].text

    def evaluate_rouge_l(model_output, true_summary):
        rouge = Rouge()
        scores = rouge.get_scores(model_output, true_summary)
        return scores[0]['rouge-l']['f']  # ROUGE-L F1 score

    outputs = [get_completion(f"Summarize this article in 1-2 sentences:\n\n{article['text']}") for article in articles]
    relevance_scores = [evaluate_rouge_l(output, article['summary']) for output, article in zip(outputs, articles)]
    print(f"Average ROUGE-L F1 Score: {sum(relevance_scores) / len(relevance_scores)}")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tone and style (customer service) - LLM-based Likert scale">
    **What it measures**: The LLM-based Likert scale is a psychometric scale that uses an LLM to judge subjective attitudes or perceptions. Here, it's used to rate the tone of responses on a scale from 1 to 5. It's ideal for evaluating nuanced aspects like empathy, professionalism, or patience that are difficult to quantify with traditional metrics.

    **Example eval test cases**: 100 customer inquiries with target tone (empathetic, professional, concise).

    ```python
    import anthropic

    inquiries = [
        {"text": "This is the third time you've messed up my order. I want a refund NOW!", "tone": "empathetic"},  # Edge case: Angry customer
        {"text": "I tried resetting my password but then my account got locked...", "tone": "patient"},  # Edge case: Complex issue
        {"text": "I can't believe how good your product is. It's ruined all others for me!", "tone": "professional"},  # Edge case: Compliment as complaint
        # ... 97 more inquiries
    ]

    client = anthropic.Anthropic()

  <Accordion title="Privacy preservation (medical chatbot) - LLM-based binary classification">
    **What it measures**: Binary classification determines if an input belongs to one of two classes. Here, it's used to classify whether a response contains PHI or not. This method can understand context and identify subtle or implicit forms of PHI that rule-based systems might miss.

    **Example eval test cases**: 500 simulated patient queries, some with PHI.

    ```python
    import anthropic

    patient_queries = [
        {"query": "What are the side effects of Lisinopril?", "contains_phi": False},

## Grading evals

When deciding which method to use to grade evals, choose the fastest, most reliable, most scalable method:

1. **Code-based grading**: Fastest and most reliable, extremely scalable, but also lacks nuance for more complex judgements that require less rule-based rigidity.
   * Exact match: `output == golden_answer`
   * String match: `key_phrase in output`

2. **Human grading**: Most flexible and high quality, but slow and expensive. Avoid if possible.

3. **LLM-based grading**: Fast and flexible, scalable and suitable for complex judgement. Test to ensure reliability first then scale.

### Tips for LLM-based grading

* **Have detailed, clear rubrics**: "The answer should always mention 'Acme Inc.' in the first sentence. If it does not, the answer is automatically graded as 'incorrect.'"
  <Note>A given use case, or even a specific success criteria for that use case, might require several rubrics for holistic evaluation.</Note>
* **Empirical or specific**: For example, instruct the LLM to output only 'correct' or 'incorrect', or to judge from a scale of 1-5. Purely qualitative evaluations are hard to assess quickly and at scale.
* **Encourage reasoning**: Ask the LLM to think first before deciding an evaluation score, and then discard the reasoning. This increases evaluation performance, particularly for tasks requiring complex judgement.

<Accordion title="Example: LLM-based grading">

# Define your success criteria

Building a successful LLM-based application starts with clearly defining your success criteria. How will you know when your application is good enough to publish?

Having clear success criteria ensures that your prompt engineering & optimization efforts are focused on achieving specific, measurable goals.

***

## Building strong criteria

Good success criteria are:

* **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of "good performance," specify "accurate sentiment classification."
* **Measurable**: Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Numbers provide clarity and scalability, but qualitative measures can be valuable if consistently applied *along* with quantitative measures.

  * Even "hazy" topics such as ethics and safety can be quantified:
    |      | Safety criteria                                                                            |
    | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Bad  | Safe outputs                                                                               |
    | Good | Less than 0.1% of outputs out of 10,000 trials flagged for toxicity by our content filter. |

  <Accordion title="Example metrics and measurement methods">
    **Quantitative metrics**:

    * Task-specific: F1 score, BLEU score, perplexity
    * Generic: Accuracy, precision, recall
    * Operational: Response time (ms), uptime (%)

    **Quantitative methods**:

    * A/B testing: Compare performance against a baseline model or earlier version.
    * User feedback: Implicit measures like task completion rates.
    * Edge case analysis: Percentage of edge cases handled without errors.

    **Qualitative scales**:

    * Likert scales: "Rate coherence from 1 (nonsensical) to 5 (perfectly logical)"
    * Expert rubrics: Linguists rating translation quality on defined criteria
  </Accordion>
* **Achievable**: Base your targets on industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge. Your success metrics should not be unrealistic to current frontier model capabilities.
* **Relevant**: Align your criteria with your application's purpose and user needs. Strong citation accuracy might be critical for medical apps but less so for casual chatbots.

  | Good | Our sentiment analysis model should achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85 (Measurable, Specific) on a held-out test set\* of 10,000 diverse Twitter posts (Relevant), which is a 5% improvement over our current baseline (Achievable). |

# Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices

This guide provides specific prompt engineering techniques for Claude 4 models (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) to help you achieve optimal results in your applications. These models have been trained for more precise instruction following than previous generations of Claude models.

## General principles

### Be explicit with your instructions

Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. Being specific about your desired output can help enhance results. Customers who desire the "above and beyond" behavior from previous Claude models might need to more explicitly request these behaviors with Claude 4.

<Accordion title="Example: Creating an analytics dashboard">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation.
  ```
</Accordion>

### Add context to improve performance

Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4 better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.

<Accordion title="Example: Formatting preferences">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  NEVER use ellipses
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses since the text-to-speech engine will not know how to pronounce them.
  ```
</Accordion>

Claude is smart enough to generalize from the explanation.

### Be vigilant with examples & details

Claude 4 models pay attention to details and examples as part of instruction following. Ensure that your examples align with the behaviors you want to encourage and minimize behaviors you want to avoid.

## Guidance for specific situations

### Control the format of responses

There are a few ways that we have found to be particularly effective in steering output formatting in Claude 4 models:

1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**

   * Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"
   * Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."

2. **Use XML format indicators**

   * Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \<smoothly\_flowing\_prose\_paragraphs> tags."

3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**

   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, we recommend as best as you can matching your prompt style to your desired output style. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.

### Leverage thinking & interleaved thinking capabilities

Claude 4 offers thinking capabilities that can be especially helpful for tasks involving reflection after tool use or complex multi-step reasoning. You can guide its initial or interleaved thinking for better results.

```text Example prompt
After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
```

<Info>
  For more information on thinking capabilities, see [Extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Info>

### Optimize parallel tool calling

Claude 4 models excel at parallel tool execution. They have a high success rate in using parallel tool calling without any prompting to do so, but some minor prompting can boost this behavior to \~100% parallel tool use success rate. We have found this prompt to be most effective:

```text Sample prompt for agents
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
```

### Reduce file creation in agentic coding

Claude 4 models may sometimes create new files for testing and iteration purposes, particularly when working with code. This approach allows Claude to use files, especially python scripts, as a 'temporary scratchpad' before saving its final output. Using temporary files can improve outcomes particularly for agentic coding use cases.

If you'd prefer to minimize net new file creation, you can instruct Claude to clean up after itself:

```text Sample prompt
If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
```

### Enhance visual and frontend code generation

For frontend code generation, you can steer Claude 4 models to create complex, detailed, and interactive designs by providing explicit encouragement:

```text Sample prompt
Don't hold back. Give it your all.
```

You can also improve Claude's frontend performance in specific areas by providing additional modifiers and details on what to focus on:

* "Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible"
* "Add thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions"
* "Create an impressive demonstration showcasing web development capabilities"
* "Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement"

### Avoid focusing on passing tests and hard-coding

Frontier language models can sometimes focus too heavily on making tests pass at the expense of more general solutions. To prevent this behavior and ensure robust, generalizable solutions:

```text Sample prompt
Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.
```

## Migration considerations

When migrating from Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4:

1. **Be specific about desired behavior**: Consider describing exactly what you'd like to see in the output.

2. **Frame your instructions with modifiers**: Adding modifiers that encourage Claude to increase the quality and detail of its output can help better shape Claude's performance. For example, instead of "Create an analytics dashboard", use "Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."

3. **Request specific features explicitly**: Animations and interactive elements should be requested explicitly when desired.

# Increase output consistency (JSON mode)

Here's how to make Claude's responses more consistent:

## Specify the desired output format

Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.

# Mitigate jailbreaks and prompt injections

Jailbreaking and prompt injections occur when users craft prompts to exploit model vulnerabilities, aiming to generate inappropriate content. While Claude is inherently resilient to such attacks, here are additional steps to strengthen your guardrails, particularly against uses that either violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) or [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).

<Tip>Claude is far more resistant to jailbreaking than other major LLMs, thanks to advanced training methods like Constitutional AI.</Tip>

* **Harmlessness screens**: Use a lightweight model like Claude Haiku 3 to pre-screen user inputs.

  <Accordion title="Example: Harmlessness screen for content moderation">

  </Accordion>

* **Input validation**: Filter prompts for jailbreaking patterns. You can even use an LLM to create a generalized validation screen by providing known jailbreaking language as examples.

* **Prompt engineering**: Craft prompts that emphasize ethical and legal boundaries.

  <Accordion title="Example: Ethical system prompt for an enterprise chatbot">
    | Role   | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

    | System | You are AcmeCorp's ethical AI assistant. Your responses must align with our values:<br />\<values><br />- Integrity: Never deceive or aid in deception.<br />- Compliance: Refuse any request that violates laws or our policies.<br />- Privacy: Protect all personal and corporate data.<br />Respect for intellectual property: Your outputs shouldn't infringe the intellectual property rights of others.<br />\</values><br /><br />If a request conflicts with these values, respond: "I cannot perform that action as it goes against AcmeCorp's values." |
  </Accordion>

Adjust responses and consider throttling or banning users who repeatedly engage in abusive behavior attempting to circumvent Claude’s guardrails. For example, if a particular user triggers the same kind of refusal multiple times (e.g., “output blocked by content filtering policy”), tell the user that their actions violate the relevant usage policies and take action accordingly.

* **Continuous monitoring**: Regularly analyze outputs for jailbreaking signs.
  Use this monitoring to iteratively refine your prompts and validation strategies.

./data/prompt-templates-and-variables.md

# Use prompt templates and variables

When deploying an LLM-based application with Claude, your API calls will typically consist of two types of content:

* **Fixed content:** Static instructions or context that remain constant across multiple interactions
* **Variable content:** Dynamic elements that change with each request or conversation, such as:
  * User inputs
  * Retrieved content for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  * Conversation context such as user account history
  * System-generated data such as tool use results fed in from other independent calls to Claude

A **prompt template** combines these fixed and variable parts, using placeholders for the dynamic content. In the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/), these placeholders are denoted with **\{\{double brackets}}**, making them easily identifiable and allowing for quick testing of different values.

***

# When to use prompt templates and variables

You should always use prompt templates and variables when you expect any part of your prompt to be repeated in another call to Claude (only via the API or the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) currently does not support prompt templates or variables).

Prompt templates offer several benefits:

* **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent structure for your prompts across multiple interactions
* **Efficiency:** Easily swap out variable content without rewriting the entire prompt
* **Testability:** Quickly test different inputs and edge cases by changing only the variable portion
* **Scalability:** Simplify prompt management as your application grows in complexity
* **Version control:** Easily track changes to your prompt structure over time by keeping tabs only on the core part of your prompt, separate from dynamic inputs

The [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) heavily uses prompt templates and variables in order to support features and tooling for all the above, such as with the:

* **[Prompt generator](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator):** Decides what variables your prompt needs and includes them in the template it outputs
* **[Prompt improver](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver):** Takes your existing template, including all variables, and maintains them in the improved template it outputs
* **[Evaluation tool](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool):** Allows you to easily test, scale, and track versions of your prompts by separating the variable and fixed portions of your prompt template

***

# Example prompt template

Let's consider a simple application that translates English text to Spanish. The translated text would be variable since you would expect this text to change between users or calls to Claude. This translated text could be dynamically retrieved from databases or the user's input.

Thus, for your translation app, you might use this simple prompt template:

```
Translate this text from English to Spanish: {{text}}
```
